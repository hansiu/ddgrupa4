Bioisosteric atoms andTextbook of drug design and discovery
groupings are those that have approximately the same size or molecular volumes so their
interchange results in similarity in chemical, physical and notably biological properties of
the resulting analogs. Classical isosteres include interchange of atoms in the same row of
the periodic chart such as—CH 2 —,—NH—,—O—and—F. Note that hydrogen atoms are
added to compensate for valence differences.This is known as the Grimm hydride
displace-ment rule. Over time the definition of isosterism has broadened to include some
isoelectronic interchanges as well. Examples of this phenomenon include—S—and—
O—as well as—F,—Cl and—Br. Bioisosteres include the classical isosteres, but
bioisosteric atoms or groups of atoms do not nescessarily overlap. However, bioisosteres
show sufficient steric, electronic or other properties to ensure biological activity similar
to the parent.
